## üìù Requirements
- Ensure Google Chrome is installed and up-to-date.
- This script uses a temporary user profile to avoid session issues.
- Change the URL or product name if the website changes.
- If you're using a custom Chrome profile, you can update the path in `main.py` with:

```python
user_data_dir = r'C:\Users\your_user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data'
```

## üß™ Test Output

The script uses `logging` to show step-by-step progress in the terminal.

Example output:
```
